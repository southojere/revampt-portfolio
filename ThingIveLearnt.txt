- thinking about your primary and secondary colors
 and making them variables first before you start.


SASS stuff

- you can deligate some styling functionality to MIXINs
e.g. @minin name {} => then using => @include name()

-@for $x from 1 through {} for loops with sass

- use of &: &. etc using nth-child() 
- transition all 0.5sec is some nice easy free animation between two states.
- use of translate instead of left and top attributes


- use transition i.e. transition: all 0.5s ease-out; and transform:translate__(...) for some nice sliding/ movemenent
    animations.
